1-Authentication: Process of identifying if the user is who the claimed they are
that's when we login
so we send our user and password to the server and the server authenticate us


2-Authorization: is determining if the user has the right permission 
to perform the giver operation

so in our vildy application we wanna make sure that only authenticated user or only logged in users
can perform operations that modify data so if the user is anonymous 
if they are not logged in...they only read data from this endpoints.

if they want to create a new genre or a new rental ..they have to be authenticated first
